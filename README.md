Project Title: Vigenere Cipher Decryption

Project Description: This is a simple C++ propgram that encrypts and decrypts messages from the user using vigenere cipher. The user is given the option to choose either encryption or decryption and enter their own plaintext and key. The program prints the final encrypted/decrypted text in the end. Although encryption of the original text is typically done using the Vigenere table, this program takes a more simple approach by visuallizing this table algebraically. 

How to use the program: Run CIS7_FinalProj.cpp in your IDE. The program will initially ask for an integer input of either 1 or 2 to choose encryption or decryption. Do not enter a different integer or a different data type as your input. The program will then prompt you to enter some text. Make sure this text is a single string wihtout spaces or symbols. The program will then prompt you to enter a key. Make sure this key is in the same format and length as the text. After these steps have been taken, the encrypted/decrypted text should appear. Congrats!
